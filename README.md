# Random Quote Generator

## Generates a random quote using local REST API. The user can also choose the category of the quote.  

Assumptions:
- The project was build using React.js (components with manageable states).
- The fetch method was applied (local REST API).

In future I would like to extend this project by following options:
- to post the quote on Twitter account,
- to save the favourite quotes in local storage.

In order to run the application in the db file the following command should be input: json-server --watch quotes.json
